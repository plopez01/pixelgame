This was a bullet hell type game I made in a couple of days. Hope you like it if you give it a try, it's not actually finished, and I don't know if it will ever be done. If you want to use the base code to make one yourself or finish this one, do it, but please give credit of the original code, and contact me! I really would like to see it!

Inspired by LiterallyNoOne CH Modchart and Undertale.

Music by Silentroom & Tanchiky - Outer Solution.
